The "Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning" project aims to develop a predictive model for early diabetes detection. By analyzing medical and lifestyle data, the model categorizes individuals as either prone or not prone to diabetes. The project involves data collection, preprocessing, and feature engineering to enhance data quality. Various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and Neural Networks, are assessed for optimal performance. The chosen model is trained and evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. Interpretability techniques provide insights into prediction factors. The user-friendly model is deployed as an application, enabling users to input their data and receive personalized diabetes risk assessments. Benefits encompass timely risk identification, encouraging healthier choices, and aiding healthcare professionals in planning treatments. Ethical considerations encompass data privacy and bias mitigation. Overall, the project offers an accessible and impactful tool for early diabetes prediction, fostering proactive health management
